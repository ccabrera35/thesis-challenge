# Thesis Challenge

This project uses `LESS` as its `CSS` preprocessor. To ensure the page loads correctly run either of the following commands at the project root:

- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  - visit: `http://localhost:8000/`
- `npx http-server -p 8000`
  - visit: `http://localhost:8000/`
- If neither of these options are available there is a compiled version of the stylesheet in `assets/styles.css`.
  - Uncomment the stylesheet commented out `<link>` in `index.html`
  - Open `index.html`
